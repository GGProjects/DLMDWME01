The directory structure is based on the general project directory
structure for Team Data Science Process developed by Microsoft. It also
contains templates for various documents that are recommended as part of
executing a data science project when using TDSP. [Team Data Science
Process
(TDSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview)
is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve
collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle
definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and
[tools](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities) for productive
data science.
